How internet works?
1)client
2)Browser
3)Server

client will send the request to browser to give the requirement for example youtube.com.
so browser will go to youtube server ask for the demand if available it take from there
and give it to client 

for example: in a restaurant hum waiter ko order dete hai vo kitchen me jata hai aur vaha
se order le aata hai lekin kabhi kabhi order unavailable bhi hota hai.like 404 error
